# Serpent
 A open-source implementation of Snake in Python, supporting both GUI and CLI.
 
 Every couple years I end up reimplementing snake in order to assess my skills as a programmer. This is my latest, and I feel most impressive, version. This implementation allows the game to be rendered either using PyGame or using a POSIX-compliant shell. 
 
While not very useful as a game of snake, though perfectly playable, this project best serves as an example of my programming style in Python.

Do whatever you'd like with this project. If you want to reach out to me, shoot me an email over at mercerweissx@gmail.com.

Thanks for reading!
